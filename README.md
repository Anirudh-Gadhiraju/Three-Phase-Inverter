# Three-Phase-Inverter
For the Simulation of a Three phase Inverter on R Load. A MATLAB Simulink model created with a 600V  connected to 6 thyristors, whose gate ports are  connected to 6 seperate pulse generator with the details defined in the simulink model. The output from the thyristor is connected to a R load. The output AC Output Voltage is Observed.
